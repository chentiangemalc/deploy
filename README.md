# Overview

## Project Goal

The goal of the deploy project is to create the client and server compoenents of an enterprise class software deployment and management toolset that is:

* free
* compact
* portable
* high performance
* simple
* reliable

The catalyst for developing this comes after the Project Owner's extensive experience with popular enterprise software management tools:

* SMS 
* SCCM (2007 & 2012)
* CA ITCM
* Altiris
* ZenWorks

Across multiple industries:

* Federal & State Government
* Airlines
* Railway
* Manufacturing
* Retail
* Logistics
* Financial Services / Banking

And finding frustration in ...

* Complex licensing schemes
* Complex software configuration (which due to complexity often gets configured wrong)
* Complex reporting
* Reliabiity Issues
* Large Client (100 MB +)
* Poor multi-platform support
* Costly Infrastructure requried for multi-site support
* Slow Performance

The project's goal is to elminate the above issues by :

* Server 100% Linux + MariaDB platform
* KISS approach (Keep It Simple Stupid)
* 100% Native Code (i.e. C++, avoid managed code)
* Fully documented Web Services API to create your own clients and/or server
* Support multiple sites from a single server
